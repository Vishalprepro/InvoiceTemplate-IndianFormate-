# Invoice Generator Template

Welcome to the **Invoice Generator Template**! This web application allows you to create professional invoices with ease. Itâ€™s built using **JavaScript**, **CSS**, and **HTML**. You can customize the invoice template, add products, calculate GST (Goods and Services Tax), and download the invoice as a PDF or image. 

This README provides detailed instructions on how to set up and use the template.

## Features

- **User Input Form**: The `invoiceform.html` page collects all necessary details such as:
  - **Buyerâ€™s Information**: Name, address, and contact details.
  - **Product Details**: Add product name, rate, GST rate, and quantity.
- **GST Calculation**:
  - **SGST** and **CGST** are automatically calculated based on the given GST rate.
  - **SGST** = GST/2, **CGST** = GST/2.
  - **SGST Amount** and **CGST Amount** are calculated as a percentage of the total amount for each product.
- **HSN Code Lookup**:
  - You can enter either an **HSN Code** or an **HSN Description**, and the system will automatically display the corresponding description or code.
  - HSN codes and descriptions are stored in a JSON file (imported from an Excel file).
- **Responsive Invoice Template**: Once the form is filled and submitted, the system generates an invoice with the calculated values and displays them in a clean template.
- **Words to Number**: Converts the final amount into words for a more professional touch.
- **Download Options**: Download the invoice as a **PDF** or **image** file.
